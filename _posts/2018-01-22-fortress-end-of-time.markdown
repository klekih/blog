---

A short novel, a dense writing style, "The fortress at the end of time" is a story about a desperate and lonely life somewhere at the end of the entire society (or the end of the universe). That end where you have no friends but neither enemies. Each one on his own. Now is a friend, tomorrow is ignoring you. 

The story tells how a life is slowly passing in a space station at the most distant point from earth where humanity reached. An almost forgotten warship, slowly reconfigured for permanently living within, an odd and hard to terraform planet with scarce resources, the picture which reveals itself is desolate. Is everything you don't want to experience. But there is no option, you're just thrown in there and nobody cares you're rookie, that wilderness you'll have to face with bare hands.

The sole reason for that station to exist is to watch for a long forgotten enemy. War memories are distant, their meaning is blurred by so many different opinions, there is no one who knows what the fight was for. There is no one who knows who was that enemy their ancestors fight with. Endless waiting. Routine and procedures everywhere. What to live for?

Eventually, the enemy reveals: yourself, the pride, the stubbornness, selfishness or unselfishness, just watch yourself.
