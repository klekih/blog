Well, sometime and somewhere I have to start. As an avid reader I must taste the „other” side, I must reverse, somehow, the process of reading and digesting so many wor(l)ds: fiction, science fiction, blogs, tech and software articles, tweets, feeds, posts, etc.

I know I’ll always find my old writings with contempt and I know I won’t escape from this vicious circle of writing, reading, despising, writing again, …

But at least I can improve myself somehow, little by little, a piece at a time. To advance matters the most.

I wish myself luck. A little.
