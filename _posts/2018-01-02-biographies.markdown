[Several](http://www.pgbovine.net/how-i-learned-programming.htm) [biographies](http://mattdeboard.net/2011/11/23/how-i-became-a-programmer/) I've [read](https://www.kchodorow.com/blog/2010/11/30/how-i-became-a-programmer/) [recently](https://danluu.com/learning-to-program/). Short and concise, written by people who pursued a career in programming, the narratives revolve around how their path eventually led to a job and profession in tech areas like programming and computer science. Except for [this one](https://github.com/tarmstrong/longcv/blob/master/bio.md), whose focus relies too much on lists of small and petty tech tricks achieved, without any attempt to draw some learnings or find a rationale behind the experience, the others were a good read. Especially [this one](https://danluu.com/learning-to-program/), a brilliant autobiography
style of depicting own experiences in such a way that it attracts attention and gives back useful information.

So here are few common traits among them, traits which I can identify also by looking back at my own experience.

- neither of them knew from early what they want or where their passion and talent are. This being in contrast with several myths of highly talented people who were meant (more or less, faith-driven) to be a great developer/writer/etc.
- most of them had a reluctance at first. Early experiences with BASIC-like languages were disagreeable mostly because there was no clear purpose of what this shiny new tech can do.
- impostor syndrome. It gets some time to know what you're capable of, where do you stand, what you can do and after this assessment how you can sell your talents and abilities.

Therefore, nothing fancy there. Only common good sense.
